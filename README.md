# Project title: Salary Prediction Project
This project aims to predict salaries based on various features using machine learning techniques. It utilizes Python along with external libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn for data analysis, visualization, and modeling. The project is deployed using Flask for backend development and HTML for creating the frontend webpage.

Project Structure:
1.	Data Collection: 
The project starts with collecting relevant data that includes features like years of experience, sex, age, designation, unit, total time in company, date of joining, current date,  job type, etc., along with corresponding salaries.
   
2.	Data Preprocessing: 
Data preprocessing involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. This step ensures the data is ready for analysis and modeling.

3.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
EDA is performed to understand the relationships between different features and the target variable (salary). Visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn help in gaining insights into the data.

4.	Model Development: 
Several machine learning models are trained on the preprocessed data to predict salaries. In this project I used regression algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, or Gradient Boosting Regression from Scikit-learn.

5.	Model Evaluation: 
The performance of each model is evaluated using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), or R-squared score to determine the best-performing model.

6.	Deployment: 
The best model is then deployed using Flask, which serves as the backend for the web application. HTML is used for creating the frontend webpage where users can input their data and get salary predictions.

Libraries Used:
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical computing and array operations.
Matplotlib: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
Seaborn: For statistical data visualization based on Matplotlib.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning models, evaluation, and preprocessing techniques.
Flask: For building and deploying web applications in Python.
HTML: For creating the frontend webpage for user interaction.
